Features:
This game is designed to make you rage quit. Hidden blocks and spikes will make your life hell. 
The graphics and sound are directly from Mario but the difficulty is nothing like Mario. Hence 
the name: Not Mario. 

Bugs:
- If a sound effect is repeated before the first one is finished, it doesn't play
- Player can still jump after walking off a platform
- Death animation sometimes runs twice

Special Instructions:
You can look at the 2D int arrays of each level to figure out where each invisible brick and 
spike is. Since this is a game designed to be a difficult, I didn't want you to suffer too much
so I recorded videos of me playing through each level. You should try the game though to experience
true anger. I didn't have time to implement a levels menu so if you want to go directly to a 
specific level, do the following:
- Set menu to false
- Set game to true and the levelState you want to true

If I had more time I would add more unique blocks to make the game more interesting. Additionally, 
I would add different themes and unique background music to each level.
